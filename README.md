## Prisoners Dilemma but with ROBOTS
Make your own stratagy to work with each other for the maxium gain. Each 'player' is given a choice... To cooperate, or defect. If you both defect, you each get 1 point. If you both cooperate, you both get 3 points. If one of you decides to defect when the other cooperates, the defecter gets 5 points while the cooperator gets 1. You get no prior communication with eachother, and you make a robot to reporsent your choices. Watch your back, as betrayal lurks at every turn.
